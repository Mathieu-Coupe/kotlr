/**
 * TextFormat - In addition to subtypes at the Text block level, the text within a Text block
 * can have inline styles like bold, italic, external links, blog mentions, and colors.
 *
 * Inline formatting ranges (start and end) are zero-indexed and count each character as 1.
 * Ranges are inclusive at the start and exclusive at the end.
 *
 * A single unicode character is also treated as one character in this indexing, despite
 * possibly being multiple bytes. For example, √∏ and üå≥ are both counted as single characters in
 * NPF. However, a composite emoji like üë®‚Äçüë®‚Äçüë¶ is five characters, as it is made up of
 * five unicode codepoints.
 *
 * Overlapping ranges of the same type should be combined or separated into non-overlapping ranges.
 * Overlapping ranges of different types should all be applied to the text, although it is up to
 * the Tumblr API to reconcile the ranges as needed to display correctly, just like
 * when nesting HTML.
