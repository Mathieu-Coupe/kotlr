Piracy is down, subscriptions are up, everyone’s making money with these contracts for your show’s streaming rights, and viewers are getting a ton of great content they enjoy. Everybody wins!</p>\n<p><b>Morons: </b>But what if we had our own streaming service just for our content?</p>\n<p><b>Netflix:</b> …I mean in-theory that would work at first, but if everyone’s content was suddenly 100% exclusive and you have to get a dozen subscriptions to a dozen proprietary streaming services just to watch three shows, that defeats a lot of the val–</p>\n<p><b>Morons: </b>And we could charge more than Netflix and Hulu too! We could make even more money!</p>\n<p><b>Netflix:</b> Well at a certain point you’re going to start charging more than people are willing to pay and you’ll start losing more money than you’ll gain.
